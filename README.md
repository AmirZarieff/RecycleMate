### **Project Details**

**Title:** RecycleMate – Smart Recycling Helper App

**Background of the Problem:**
Although recycling is encouraged worldwide, many adults still struggle to understand what can and cannot be recycled. Items like plastic containers, packaging, paper, and glass are often thrown into the wrong bin due to confusion. Incorrect sorting leads to contamination, making recyclable materials unusable and contributing to higher landfill waste. Adults may want to recycle, but inconsistent rules and lack of clear information make it difficult. A simple mobile app that gives instant guidance can help people recycle correctly and support environmental sustainability.

**Purpose / Objective:**
RecycleMate aims to help adults make smarter and more environmentally friendly waste disposal decisions. The main objectives are:

* Identify whether an item is recyclable, non-recyclable, or requires special handling.
* Provide correct disposal instructions in a simple and clear manner.
* Educate users with recycling tips and common mistakes to avoid.
* Encourage consistent recycling habits using a built-in tracking system.
* Offer a fast and convenient tool that supports sustainable lifestyle choices.

**Target Users:**
The app is designed for adults aged 18–60, especially:

* Homeowners
* Working adults
* Parents
* People who manage household waste
* Anyone who wants clearer recycling information

**Preferred Platform:**
**Flutter (Android)** – chosen because:

* Enables fast UI design with built-in widgets.
* Integrates well with Firebase Authentication & Cloud Firestore.
* Supports required packages, plugins, and state management.
* Cross-platform (Android → iOS future-ready).
* Matches course requirement to use Flutter + Backend as a Service.
